BETTERHELP – FEATURES
-------------------------------------------
• Over 15,000 counselors & therapists with different areas of expertise
• All counselors are licensed, trained, accredited and highly experienced
• Match with an available counselor who is the best fit for your needs
• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist
• Schedule live sessions with your counselor or use the secure messenger
• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars
 
PROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU
Facing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional counselor has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.
 
LICENSED AND TRAINED COUNSELORS & THERAPISTS
There are over 15,000 counselors in BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 1,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials.
 
All of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective fields. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board and have completed the necessary education, exams, training and practice.
 
HOW DOES IT WORK?
After filling out our questionnaire, you will be matched with a licensed counselor based on your needs and preferences. You and your counselor will get your own secure and private “counseling room” where you can message your counselor at any time, from any internet-connected device, wherever you are. You can also schedule a session so speak live with your counselor over video or phone.
 
You can write or talk about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you’re facing and your counselor will provide feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your counselor.
 
Together you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals and overcoming your problems.
 
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
The cost of counseling through BetterHelp ranges from $60 to $90 per week (billed every 4 weeks) and it is based on your location, preferences, and therapist availability. Unlike traditional in-office therapy which can cost over $150 for a single session, your BetterHelp membership includes unlimited text, video, audio messaging as well as weekly live sessions. The subscription is billed and renewed every 4 weeks and includes both the use of the secured site and the counseling service itself. You can cancel your membership at any time for any reason.
